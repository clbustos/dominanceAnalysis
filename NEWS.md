# dominanceanalysis 1.3.0

- Added plot() method for dominanceAnalysis object.
- Added support for beta regression, using betareg package. Suggestion by Maartje Hidalgo
- Added 'ordered' parameter to dominanceMatrix() method
- Bug fix: Fixed some mistakes on logistic regression vignette on v1.2.0. Added some plots, to compensate.

# dominanceanalysis 1.2.0

- Added documentation for da.dynlm.fit. 
- Test for esoph example. 
- New Acknowledgments section in README file
- Removed dependencies on caTools and heplots, because are used only for examples.
- Bug fix: Logistic regression indexes failed on some models. Null model likelihood is now correctly calculated using update(x,~1). . Report by Daniel Schlaepfer.
- Added (basic) support for dynamic linear models, using dynlm package.  Suggestion by Xiong Zhang.
